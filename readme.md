[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/USCbiostats/amcmc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/USCbiostats/amcmc) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/USCbiostats/amcmc?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/USCbiostats/amcmc) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/USCbiostats/amcmc/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/USCbiostats/amcmc?branch=master)

The `amcmc` R package implements out-of-the-box methods for Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Optimal Scaling Algorithms of Random Walk MCMC. Designed to be used with the `coda` R package, `amcmc` allows running multiple chains simultaneously (parallel computing), using Parallel Tempering MCMC, and Random Walks with Reflecting Boundaries.
