The `amcmc` R package implements out-of-the-box methods for Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Optimal Scaling Algorithms of Random Walk MCMC. Designed to be used with the `coda` R package, `amcmc` allows running multiple chains simultaneously (parallel computing), using Parallel Tempering MCMC, and Random Walks with Reflecting Boundaries.
